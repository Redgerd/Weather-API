# Weather-API
In this project, instead of relying on our own weather data, we will build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from a 3rd party API. This project will help you understand how to work with 3rd party APIs, caching, and environment variables.

The idea for this project was taken from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). You can find more details about the original project [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service).
